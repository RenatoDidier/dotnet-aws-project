.NET Clean Architecture on AWS CloudFormation

📌 Overview
This project is a .NET application deployed on AWS using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with AWS CloudFormation.
It's a monorepo study project where, for each folder, we'll have a completely different infrastructure on AWS.
This project is using GitHub Actions to deploy the code to the infrastructure generated by AWS CloudFormation.

## 📁 aws-tutorial

This folder contains a **basic AWS CloudFormation example** that provisions an **EC2-based web server**.

The stack creates:

- An **EC2 instance** running Amazon Linux 2
- A **Security Group** allowing inbound HTTP traffic (port 80), configurable by CIDR
- Instance bootstrapping via **User Data** to install and start Apache (`httpd`)

The infrastructure is deployed through **GitHub Actions using OIDC authentication**, with a workflow that validates and deploys the CloudFormation template on demand.

This project is intended as an **introductory Infrastructure as Code (IaC) example**, focusing on EC2 provisioning and CI/CD integration with AWS.
